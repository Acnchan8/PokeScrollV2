# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: **Austin Chan**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**PokeScroll V2** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of random Pok√©mon using the Pok√©API. Users can initiate the generation of random Pok√©mon by pressing a button, which then hides itself and a Pokeball image to reveal a list of Pok√©mon. Each list item displays a Pok√©mon's sprite, name, and types, offering fans a fun way to explore Pok√©mon details.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üêæüåàüìú
